# Todo Challenge: Reprise

Trying to redo and complete the Makers Academy 7th week's Todo Challenge.
The app should be built mainly using parts of the MEAN stack and strict TDD/Feature testing discipline.

Features to add:
- "clear all" function
- "clear completed" function
- "edit todo" feature
- "archive completed" and "show completed" functions
- user registration and login/logout 
- user personal todo storage in the DB

Features added:
- displaying todos
- adding todos
- toggling between "done" and "not done" states
